Webserver:
  This code runs an active webserver that allows the user to retrieve any files that are located in the same directory as
  this python file. By simply typing in the localhost, the port number located in the file and the name of the file with the
  extension, the webserver should show you a webpage containing the file requested.
  
Mail Client:
  This code sends an email containing a body message from a gmail account to a recipient.
